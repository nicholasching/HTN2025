# Wingman 🤝  

## Our Project  
We set out to make communication easier for students, whether it’s starting a conversation, keeping it going, or following up. From setting up a coffee chat on LinkedIn to chatting on Tinder, our tool acts as a wingman for better messaging. Built as an all-in-one web app that unifies all your social platforms, it features AI chat summaries, assistants for both casual and professional replies, language clarification tools to make messages context-appropriate, and textual and voice automation for drafting and sending messages.
